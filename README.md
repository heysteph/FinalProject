## Brief description
The Olympics have been around for almost 3,000 years and people from around the world still unites once every 4 years to compete in this highly celebrated competition. Both the athletes and country they represents will be impacted when they win more medals: incentives and reputation. In this project, the author would like to use sports analytics and find the factors to win most medals.
