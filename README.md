# Final Project

## Brief description
In this final project, we would like to analyze the game of chess that's been played since 6 CE. With the goal of predicting the winner, the author utilizes online chess data set and several statistical methods (Logistic Regression, K-NN Classifier, Decision Trees) and obtained a ~60% accuracy. In hopes to improve this, the author came up with a win metric that compares the moves used by player to an advanced chess engine, Stockfish. This metric has an accuracy of 61% and can be further improved by tuning the parameters.

## Data set
games.csv is used as the main dataframe, it is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess and holds 20,058 chess games from Lichess.org
